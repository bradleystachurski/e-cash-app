## Transaction Hash and Explorer Links Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS:

1. **Modified Rust Transaction struct** - Added optional `txid: Option<String>` and `block_time: Option<u64>` fields
   - Location: `rust/carbine_fedimint/src/multimint.rs` lines 134-135

2. **Updated transaction retrieval logic** - Modified wallet transaction creation to populate txid and block_time fields:
   - Deposit transactions: Extract txid from `DepositStateV2::Claimed { btc_out_point }` and fetch block_time from explorer
   - Withdrawal transactions: Extract txid from `WithdrawState::Succeeded(txid)` and fetch block_time from explorer  
   - Non-wallet transactions (lightning, ecash): Set txid and block_time to None
   - Location: `rust/carbine_fedimint/src/multimint.rs` lines ~1854-1905

3. **Added block explorer API calls** - Implemented `fetch_tx_block_time()` function to query block explorers:
   - Supports mempool.space (Bitcoin), mutinynet.com (Signet), and localhost (Regtest)
   - Fetches `block_time` field from transaction API response
   - Location: `rust/carbine_fedimint/src/multimint.rs` lines 740-766

4. **Regenerated Flutter bindings** - Ran `just generate` to update Dart Transaction model with both txid and blockTime fields
   - Location: `lib/multimint.dart` lines 457-458

5. **Updated Flutter UI** - Enhanced transaction details modal:
   - Changed "Date" field to "Address Created" for better clarity
   - Added "Block Inclusion Time" field for on-chain transactions with block_time data
   - Added txid display with copy functionality for on-chain transactions
   - Added blockchain explorer links: mempool.space for mainnet, mutinynet.com for signet
   - Location: `lib/widgets/transaction_detail_modal.dart` lines 91, 130-137, 249-252

6. **Network detection** - Uses federation.network field to determine explorer:
   - 'bitcoin' -> https://mempool.space/tx/{txid}
   - 'signet' -> https://mutinynet.com/tx/{txid}

### ‚úÖ TESTING STATUS:
- Rust compilation successful (`just build-linux`)
- Flutter bindings regenerated successfully (`just generate`)
- Dart code formatted successfully (`dart format lib/*.dart`)
- Flutter analysis passed (no new errors introduced)

### üéØ WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED:
The transaction details modal now shows:
- "Address Created" field (renamed from "Date" for clarity)
- "Block Inclusion Time" field (only for on-chain wallet transactions with block time data)
- Transaction Hash field (only for on-chain wallet transactions)  
- Formatted txid with copy button
- "View on blockchain explorer" link when network is known
- Links to appropriate explorer based on federation network

**NEW FEATURES ADDED:**
- **Block time fetching**: Queries block explorers (mempool.space, mutinynet.com) to get transaction inclusion time
- **Smart field display**: Shows block inclusion time only when available for on-chain transactions
- **Improved labeling**: "Address Created" vs "Block Inclusion Time" for better user understanding

### üìÅ KEY FILES MODIFIED:
- `rust/carbine_fedimint/src/multimint.rs` - Added block_time field, fetch_tx_block_time() function, and population logic
- `lib/widgets/transaction_detail_modal.dart` - Added block inclusion time display and improved field labels
- `lib/multimint.dart` - Updated Transaction model with blockTime field (auto-generated)

### üß™ TO TEST:
1. Run the app with `just run`
2. Make an on-chain deposit or withdrawal 
3. View transaction details - should show:
   - "Address Created" field (timestamp when address was created)
   - "Block Inclusion Time" field (when transaction was included in block, if available)
   - "Transaction Hash" field with copy functionality
   - "View on blockchain explorer" link
4. Test copy functionality and explorer links
5. Verify block inclusion time appears only for confirmed on-chain transactions

The enhanced implementation is complete and ready for use!
