# APK Build Fix for Nix Flake

## Summary

• **Android Gradle Configuration**: Updated build files to use Java 21, fixed dependency versions, and made Flutter SDK properties configurable with fallback defaults
• **NixOS Binary Patching**: Added automated Gradle init script to patch Android build tools (aapt2, aapt, zipalign) for NixOS compatibility using auto-patchelf
• **Nix Flake Environment**: Configured proper Android SDK packages, created minimal writable Flutter tools copy, and set up environment variables for gradle builds
• **Build Tool Integration**: Added gradle to nix environment, configured proper JAVA_HOME and gradle init directory for seamless APK builds

These changes enable Flutter APK builds to work within the Nix flake environment by resolving binary compatibility issues and providing proper Android SDK configuration.
