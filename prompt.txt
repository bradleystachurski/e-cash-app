have a look at the the example.png at the root of the repo. it shows the current state of the on chain withdrawal transaction detail. some of the data is useful but it's not very cleanly presented. the address created time and the block inclusion time are not formatted the same and they should be in rows next to each other. I think the block inclusion time should be right below the address created time. can you figure out how to accomplish that?
