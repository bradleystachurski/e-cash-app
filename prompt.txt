have a look at on_chain_send_details.png and on_chain_receive_details.png at the root of the repo. we need to make some updates.

for receives
- rename address created to deposit address created
- get rid of payment type, it's already obvious and not useful additional info
- get rid of  direction received
  - that's also already obvious
- get rid of operation id, that's not relevant for the user

for sends
- address created doesn't make sense
  - instead this is when the withdrawal is initiated
- get rid of payment type, it's already obvious and not useful additional info
- get rid of  direction sent
  - that's also already obvious
- get rid of operation id, that's not relevant for the user
